*nvim-juice* is my personal Neovim configuration written in
https://fennel-lang.org[Fennel].

* Concisely configures Neovim using Fennel via
https://github.com/Olical/nfnl[nfnl]
* Manages packages via https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim[lazy.nvim]

== Quick start

To install, simply clone the following repositories and run nvim:

```
git clone https://github.com/rfmejia/nvim-juice ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvim
git clone https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim into ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/nvim/site/pack/juice/start
git clone https://github.com/Olical/nfnl into ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/nvim/site/pack/juice/start
nvim
```

== Modifying Fennel configuration

All configuration is located in `fnl/`. `nfnl` automatically compiles Fennel
files upon saving into `lua/`. Note that special handling is performed for
`init.fnl` and `after/` to conform to the Neovim directory structure; see
`.nfnl.fnl` for the mapping function.
