*nvim-juice* is my personal Neovim configuration written in
https://fennel-lang.org[Fennel].

* Concisely configures Neovim using Fennel via https://github.com/Olical/nfnl[nfnl]
* Automatically bootstraps https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim[lazy.nvim] for package management

== Quick start

To install, simply clone the following repositories and run nvim:

```
git clone https://github.com/rfmejia/nvim-juice ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvim
git clone https://github.com/Olical/nfnl ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/nvim/site/pack/juice/start/nfnl
nvim
```

== Modifying Fennel configuration

All configuration is located in `fnl/`. `nfnl` automatically compiles Fennel
files upon saving into `lua/`. Note that special handling is performed for
`fnl/init.fnl` and `fnl/after/` to conform to the Neovim directory structure;
see `.nfnl.fnl` for the mapping function.
