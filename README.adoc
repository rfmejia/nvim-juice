*nvim-juice* is my personal Neovim configuration written in
https://fennel-lang.org[Fennel].

* Bootstrap dependencies upon first run
* Automatically compile fennel config files into lua using
https://github.com/Olical/nfnl[nfnl]
* Manage packages using https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim[lazy.nvim]

== Quick start

To install, simply clone this repository to your `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}` and run
nvim:

```
git clone https://github.com/rfmejia/nvim-juice ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvim
nvim
```

== Modifying Fennel configuration

All configuration is located in `fnl/`. `nfnl` automatically compiles fennel
files upon saving into `lua/`. Special handling is performed for `fnl/init.fnl`
and `fnl/after/` to conform to the Neovim directory structure; see `.nfnl.fnl`
for the mapping function.
